### What I learned

Its been a week since i uploaded any project on frontend mentor, so after started to learn REACT, it was overwhelming, i want to learn more before starting to build projects, which is a common phase for me whenever i got introduced a new thing.

So by watching those tutorials and actually i did completed a small project previously (result summary component) one, but this project has a lot of things, i think mostly are not that advanced, now when i completed i'm seeing it that way, but before it looks like a mess.

although i took help from gemini, i layed-out the cards and i knew how to change the state for add to cart buttons and how to add a counter for increasing the quantity, but it was a week ago i knew, so with a little push it came along,

but the main problem was rendering selected cards with correct quantity, that took a lot of time even with gemini, and then as it always happens, gemini provide a code which i didn't understands very well, its mostly a automatic code which works under the hood, so i can't see how is it working.(i think you know what i am trying to say).

anyways, it was a good experience, that's how you learn, now if i had to apply same login in another project i will know how to do it, yes i have to open this file and then change accordingly but after some projects i'll do it on my own.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
